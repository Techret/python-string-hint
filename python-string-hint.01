''' String is another data types in python programming that is made of up sequence of letters and numbers
there embedded in single, double, or triple quotes(long strings, or multiline) as the case may be
the string lateral is a combination of string expression in python
The \ and n are escape characters and they indicate newline
the \ and t are tab characters
Strings are immutable, its value can be accessed not swapped.
string is generally anything that can be encoded in text and bytes. it can be used for media files, network
transfer, and the decoded/encoded types of non-ASCII unicode text  
also, adding commas between string laterals automatically makes it a tuple and tuples are immutable as well
The raw strings overrides the Escape character, when the r letter appears before a string text that contains the \ 
character, its mechanism is suspended. eg, file_tag = open(r'C:\old\text.dat,'w')
two backslash can be used alternatively to suppress a single backslash operations
the + and * operator can be used to concatenate strings, iterations is possible as well with the use of for loops.
The string characters can be indexed and sliced at the same time, the in and not operator can be used as well
some useful string methods include;
.startwith(), .endswith(), .isalpha(), .isalnum(). isdigit(), .isdecimal(), isspace(), istitle()
.lower(), .upper(), .title(), .join(), .split()'''
